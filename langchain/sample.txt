Title: The Calm Before the Storm

It was a quiet morning in the village. Birds chirped in the distance, and a light breeze rustled the leaves.
Few could predict the chaos that would unfold by nightfall.

The baker, unaware of what was to come, kneaded his dough with practiced ease.
Children laughed as they chased one another through the dusty streets.

But overhead, the clouds thickened.

By evening, the sky turned an ominous gray, and the first distant rumble of thunder echoed across the hills.

End.
